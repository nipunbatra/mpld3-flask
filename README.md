NB: The mpld3 API has changed a bit. I shall update the code soon to reflect that. 
The changes are fairly minimal (such as `fig_to_d3` to `fig_to_html`)

mpld3-flask
-----------

Minimal flask app for rendering D3 figures generated via mpld3. 

Demo: http://frozen-brushlands-3876.herokuapp.com/

#### TODO

Adding following plots:

1. Timeseries (maybe Yahoo Stock)
2. Scatter (maybe iris)


Add another tab on the app which plot different statistical distributions and uses sliders etc. to understand the behavior with varying parameters.

Add loading... so that the end user is aware of the state.
